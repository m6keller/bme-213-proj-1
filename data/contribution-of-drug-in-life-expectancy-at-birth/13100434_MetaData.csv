1,"Sources: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics, Death Database and Demography Division (population estimates)."
2,"Life expectancy is the number of years a person would be expected to live, starting from birth (for life expectancy at birth) and similarly for other age groups, if the age- and sex-specific mortality rates for a given observation period (such as a calendar year) were held constant over the estimated life span."
3,"This table uses life expectancy calculations based on three consecutive years of death data and population estimates."
4,"The method used for decomposition of life expectancy is the Arriaga method. Please find the methodology here in Arriaga, E. (1984). Measuring and explaining the change in life expectancies. Demography, 21(1), pp.83-96 and Arriaga, E. (1989). Changing trends in mortality decline during the last decades. In Ruzicka, L., Wunsch, G., Kane, P. International Studies in Demography (pp.105-129). Oxford, England: Claredon Press."
5,"Elements from the abridged life table are used in the decomposition of life expectancy. Abridged life tables are calculated by 5-year age groups and sex. Life expectancy is calculated according the methodology described in <a href=""http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc.action?ObjId=84-538-X&ObjType=2&lang=en&limit=0"">Methods for Constructing Life Tables for Canada, Provinces and Territories, catalogue no. 84-538</a>."
6,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period, (...) for figures not applicable and (x) for figures suppressed to meet the confidentiality requirements of the Statistics Act."
7,"Due to improvements in methodology and timeliness, the duration of data collection has been shortened compared to previous years. As a result, there may have been fewer deaths captured by the time of the release. The 2017 data are therefore considered preliminary."
8,"Numbers may not add to totals due to rounding."
9,"Data on deaths that occurred in Yukon or to residents of Yukon in other provinces or territories are not available for 2017. Therefore, life expectancy and the decomposition of life expectancy have not been calculated for Yukon for the 2015/2017 reference period. Data for Yukon in 2017 was imputed using data from Yukon 2016 for the purpose of calculating Life expectancy and the decomposition of life expectancy for Canada in 2015/2017."
10,"Changes in life expectancy data presented in this table are tabulated by place of residence."
11,"Health regions are administrative areas defined by provincial ministries of health according to provincial legislation. The health regions presented in this table are based on boundaries and names in effect as of December 2018. For complete Canadian coverage, each northern territory represents a health region."
12,"In Ontario, Public Health Units (PHU) administer health promotion and disease prevention programs. Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) are responsible for planning, funding and administering health care programs and services across the province. Data are provided for both PHUs and LHINs."
13,"To avoid data suppression, northern regions in Saskatchewan have been grouped with neighbouring regions, as follows: Athabasca Health Authority (4713) is combined with Mamawetan Churchill River Regional Health Authority (4711) and Keewatin Yatthé Regional Health Authority (4712) and referred to as Mamawetan/Keewatin/Athabasca (4714)."
14,"Drug codes (T codes from the World Health Organization International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, ICD-10) are available in the multiple cause of death database, and were only considered when the underlying cause of death was within one of the drug poisoning categories (accidental drug poisoning: X40-X44, suicide by drug poisoning: X60-X64, or drug poisoning of undetermined intent: Y10-Y14)."
15,"Data for the changes in life expectancy over the last one year compares the three year reference period (2015/2017) to the three year period immediately prior (2014/2016). Data for the changes in life expectancy over the last five years compares the three year reference period (2015/2017) to the three year period five years prior (2010/2012), and for changes in life expectancy over the last ten years compares the three year reference period (2015/2017) to the three year period ten years prior (2005/2007)."
16,"Life expectancy estimates in this table may differ from those found in similar data published by Demography (table 13-10-0114), as the data here have been taken from abridged life tables rather than complete life tables. Abridged life tables and complete life tables are built using different methodologies."
